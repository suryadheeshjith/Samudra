# Samudra 🌊
This repository contains the code of the Samudra Ocean Emulator described in the paper ["Samudra: An AI Global Ocean Emulator for Climate"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03795). Samudra is a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth.

### TODO
- [ ] Fix environment.yml
- [ ] Training code

### Key features

✅ Reliable: Capable of reproducing the temperature structure and variability of a realistic 3D ocean climate model

✅ Stable: run for multiple centuries in a realistic configuration with time-dependent forcing while maintaining stability and accuracy 

✅ Fast: it is 🚅150 times faster🚅 than its original counterpart 

✅ Open: Samudra is available on Hugging Face. Anyone can now run a global ocean emulator!

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository. 
2. Create a new conda environment using the `environment.yml` file.
3. Run the notebook `samudra_rollout.ipynb` to see how to generate a rollout with trained model weights.

### Model Weights and Data
The model weights are currently hosted on huggingface and can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/M2LInES/Samudra). The OM4 data used for training and testing the models in the paper can be accessed using: 

```python
import xarray as xr
data = xr.open_dataset("https://nyu1.osn.mghpcc.org/m2lines-pubs/Samudra/OM4", engine='zarr', chunks={})
```

For more details on the data and the model, please refer to the paper.
